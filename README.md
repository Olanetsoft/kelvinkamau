### Hi there üëã

I'm a design thinking leader and engineering hybrid. I am able to break down complex problems, research, use analytics and strategy in building, managing and thoughtfully iterating from ‚Äúminimal lovable‚Äù to mature, best-in-class product experiences. I always aim to maintain an extremely high bar for quality and consistency through critiques, design principles, and reviews. Coming from an engineering background I have worked to develop tools that democratize design practices across an organization to enable teams to understand the design process and how it's integrated at each phase.

I work with some notable companies from across Africa including Equity Group, Safaricom PLC, Absa Mauritius, KenyaBuzz, KCB Group (for KCB Bank, Vooma & National Bank), Old Mutual Nigeria, Nation Media Group, ZooshPay, Britam, Airtel Kenya, Radio Africa Group, Better Games Zambia & Kuwazo Capital Ltd.
